### NHS Digital

`Oct 2020 - Present`
__Data Services Alliance - Data Processing Service Portal__

DPS Portal aims to provide a single, secure and intuitive portal for providers to submit data into NHS Digital. The portal consists of a simple file upload webapp with a backend that integrates with DPS Core for processing, derivations and reporting. 

Proposed, instructed and implemented the conversion of the laden with tech debt Angular.js webapp to React. As a maintainer of the __nhsuk-react-components__ library, I saw the benefit of migrating the existing application to not only ease development effort but also due to the pace the portal was originally developed, a complete rewrite would be the easiest way to remove the tech debt. <br>
\- Lead a React101 session with the team, explaining key concepts, interactive demo to setup a React App and install __nhsuk-react-components__, with basic usage and maintenance explained.<br>
\- Proposed React development using alternative tooling by default, allowing experimentation of alternatives that would aid the development workflow: e.g. __Yarn__ in place of __NPM__; __Cypress__ in place of __Jest__.<br>
\- Implement __npm audit__ package vulnerability scanning into the build pipeline.<br>
\- Implement __ESLint__ code linting, into the unit test runner.<br>
\- Incorporate Automated Accesisbility testing into the build pipeline.
